            Event Photography is all about capturing split second moments that last a lifetime or at least until next years event! 
            From Corporate Conferences to 80th Birthday Parties, our promise, is to capture those images that reflect the spirit 
            and atmosphere of the event and leave you with lasting images that make you smile. Event Photography isn't a question 
            of point and shoot, it's about immersing yourself in the occasion, listening to what's being said and watching where 
            the next smile will come from.
