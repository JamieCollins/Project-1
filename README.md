# JCM PHOTOGRAPHY

## ABOUT

JCM Photography is a small, Dublin based group of photographers.
The target audience of the website is primarily young people aged 20-35 as weddings are a primary source of business, however we also do events such as birthday or corporate and also headshots, family portraits.
The goal of the website is to demonstrate a sophisticated, classy feel through design and also proof of work through the gallery and the video.
The primary goal is then to obtain new customers via the website by utilising the contact section.
