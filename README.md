Site has been tested by multiple users across many devices with no major issues.

All buttons or links on page are operating as expected. All external sites open in a new tab.

### Performance improvement: 

*To slightly improve performance, video can be hosted on external site such as Youtube.

### UNFIXED/KNOWN ISSUES

* Submission of form leads to error 404, submssion has no destination. Server sided programming language such as .php would be required to handle the form data.

#### MOBILE

* Logo becomes too large when clicked on mobile due to enlargement on hover.
* Home page text container sizes uneven.
* Text too small on home page.
* Contact link too large.


### FIXED ISSUE

* Large images producing longer load times, changed file type from .jpeg or .png to .webp to improve load.
* Home images clipping on mobile, added media queries to adjust placement.
* "Created by" credit dissapering under 500 pixel wide screens, removed social media icons left float to compensate.

## DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

None of the code was directly copied from elsewhere.

Some issues were encountered and solutions to these problems were found via help from Google, W3Schools and YouTube. Most issues were due to element placing across different screen sizes.
