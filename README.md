# JCM PHOTOGRAPHY

## ABOUT

JCM Photography is a small, Dublin based group of photographers.
The target audience of the website is primarily young people aged 20-35 as weddings are a primary source of business, however we also do events such as birthday or corporate and also headshots, family portraits.
The goal of the website is to demonstrate a sophisticated, classy feel through design and also proof of work through the gallery and the video.
The primary goal is then to obtain new customers via the website by utilising the contact section.

Google DevTools Lighthouse Testing:

### Performance improvement: 
The lower score of 89 on performance on Google Lighthouse testing was caused mostly due to large content such as images and the video.
Ideas to improve this score would be the following: 
* Host video on alternative site such as youtube.
* Convert all images to formats such as .webp to reduce file sizes.

### UNFIXED/KNOWN ISSUES

* Submission of form leads to error 404, submssion has no destination

### FIXED ISSUE

"image-2" on landing page clipping over 1600 pixels - removed border radius to resolve issue.
